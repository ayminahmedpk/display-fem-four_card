Change layout type to grid - get rid of flex rows, use grid template areas
instead. Flatten markup. Grid gap for desktop.

Consider

    a b d
    a b d
    a c d
    a c d

    for desktop grid, with top/bottom margins to auto to center a/d if possible.

Replace card top border with inset box-shadow.

Place individual cards vertically in pixel perfect fashion for the mobile
version - INDIVIDUALLY with note as to why

Make sure mobile and desktop versions are pixel perfect when hardcoded
