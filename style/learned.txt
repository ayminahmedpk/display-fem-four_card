Figma and letter spacing:

    Figma can have letter-spacing as % values,
    and the % is calculated based on the font-size.

    However, in the browser (at least in Chrome), % values are invalid.
    Use em instead.

    So 0.05% in Figma becomes 0.005em in CSS.



Vertically centering using margin auto (issues):

    "In fact, the nature of document flow and element height calculation
     algorithms make it impossible to use margins for centering an element
     vertically inside its parent. Whenever a vertical margin's value is
     changed, it will trigger a parent element height re-calculation (re-flow),
     which would in turn trigger a re-center of the original element... making
     it an infinite loop."

    Basically, can't use margin-top: auto to vertically center an element. We
    are recommended by stackoverlow to use flexbox or positioning instead.
    
    Simply changing the parent container to "display : flex;" will magically
    make it apply margin-top: auto; or margin-bot: auto; the way you expect it
    to.


Border size and internal spacing:

    Yes, border-box makes it such that the border is added to the inside of the
    box, without increasing its total height.

    However, the border is a separate entity from the box's inner content (even
    its padding), so it will push everything inside the box further back.

    So a border top of 4px will push everything in the box lower by 4px,
    effectively increasing the top padding by 4px.

    Keep that in mind when setting a container's padding and inner content's
    margin-top.
